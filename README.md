# Product Performance Analytics

Project Overview

This project was designed to gain hands-on experience in Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) and their role in product analytics. By simulating a real-world scenario similar to Canva, we generated synthetic data using Python to replicate user interactions, subscription details, and time-based trends.

The project focuses on data generation, storage, analysis, and visualization using modern data tools and cloud infrastructure.

Datasets

The project includes three primary datasets:

User Interaction Data

Tracks user activity such as project creation, project downloads, editor opens
Captures metadata like platform (mobile/web), country, user type (new/returning)
Contains unique identifiers (user_id, event_id, event_name, date)

Date Mapping Data

Maps dates to weeks and quarters for time-based trend analysis

Subscription Data

Logs subscription details including type (monthly/yearly), price, discounts, cancellation reasons

Technology Stack

Data Generation & Processing: Python

Storage: Amazon S3 (for scalable data storage)

Data Warehouse: Amazon Redshift (for analytical processing)

Visualization: Tableau (https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/sayyed.asifb.rizvi/viz/Product_Analytics_v2024_2/Dashboard2)

Key KPIs & Insights

This project enables the analysis of crucial product metrics, including:

✔️ User Engagement: Monthly Active Users (MAU), Weekly Active Users (WAU), Number of project creators, Number of exporters

✔️ Feature Usage: Projects created, Editor opens, Projects exported

✔️ Subscription Metrics: Gross Annual Recurring Revenue (ARR), Monthly/Yearly Cancel ARR

Some of the key KPIs that can be derived from the generated data include:

Number of projects created,
Number of projects exported,
Number of editor opens,
Number of exporters,
Number of project creators,
Monthly Active Users (MAU),
Weekly Active Users (WAU),
Gross Annual Recurring Revenue (ARR),
Monthly and yearly Cancel ARR.

Conclusion
This project provides practical experience in product analytics, covering end-to-end workflows from data generation to visualization. It serves as a strong foundation for understanding KPI-driven decision-making in real-world product environments.



This project serves as a practical exploration of KPIs commonly used in product analytics and provides hands-on experience in data generation, storage, analysis, and visualization using modern tools and technologies.
